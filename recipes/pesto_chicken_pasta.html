            <li>1 ounce Parmesan cheese (about 1/2 firmly packed cup finely grated or

            <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 2 small)</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, divided, plus more as needed</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>12 ounces dried penne or other tube shaped pasta</li>
            <li/>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li/>5 ounces baby spinach (about 5 cups)</li>
            <li/>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li/>1/2 cup basil pesto</li>
            <li/>Fresh basil leaves, for garnish (optional)</li>
        </ul>


    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, mince 2 garlic cloves. Finely grate 1 ounce Parmesan cheese (about 1/2 packed cup) or measure out 1/3 cup store-bought grated. Pat 1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts dry with paper towels and cut into 1-inch cubes. Season the chicken all over with 1/2 teaspoon of the kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper.</li>
            <li>Add 12 ounces dried penne pasta to the boiling water and cook according to package directions until al dente,10 to 12 minutes. Meanwhile, cook the chicken.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a 12-inch or larger high-sided skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the chicken in a single layer and cook, flipping occasionally, until cooked through and browned all over, 5 to 8 minutes total. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. If the pasta is not ready yet, remove the pan from the heat.</li>
            <li>When the pasta is ready, transfer 1/2 cup of the pasta water to the pan with the chicken, then drain the pasta. Add 1 cup heavy cream, 1/2 cup basil pesto, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt to the chicken and stir to combine. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is reduced and thickened slightly, 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the Parmesan and pasta to the sauce and toss to combine. Add 5 ounces baby spinach a handful at a time, stirring each handful into the pasta until wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Taste and season with more kosher salt as needed. Serve garnished with more grated Parmesan cheese and fresh basil leaves if desired.</li>
          
        </ol>
